# config dotfiles scripts and all the other fun stuff

## stuff to use
- [Termina](https://github.com/siduck76/st) An `st` improvement. The installation might be tricky. I had to checkout the project in ~/st. Needed to run `sudo make clean` and `sudo make uninstall` and somehow even manually remove another `src/st` or `st` folder inside the repo. After some final `sudo make install` it *MAGICALLY* worked...
- [ls-icons](https://github.com/Yash-Handa/logo-ls)
Full of bugs. Use at your own risk. Better not to touch anything here!
- awesome themes from [here](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats)
